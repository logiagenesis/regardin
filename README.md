# Regardin Construction

A static, multi-page website for Regardin Construction in Cape Town. Built with HTML, hand-written CSS and progressive vanilla JavaScript, compiled by Vite. Target repository: `logiagenesis/REgardin_GPT`.

This is the consolidated working project for `REgardin-Construction`, `REgardin_GPT` and the supplied Drive brief/audits. See [source reconciliation](docs/project-integration.md) for the imported tooling, retained implementation and source references. The earlier scaffold's command names remain available here. Use `nvm use` to select Node 24, then `npm run audit` for the complete local release checks.

## Develop

Use Node 24 (minimum 22.12). PHP 8.2+ with PDO SQLite and fileinfo is used for cPanel enquiry tests. From this checkout:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
bash scripts/setup-php.sh
npm run package:cpanel
npm run dev
```

The environment already isolates the task: use this checkout; do not create another worktree unless requested.

```sh
npm run build
npm run check
npm run lint
npm run audit:html
npm run test:unit
CHROME_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium npm test
CHROME_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium npm run audit:lighthouse
```

The default build is a **noindex design preview**. `npm run build:production` deliberately fails until the outstanding approvals are resolved. See `HANDOVER.md` and `docs/runbook.md`. Image assets are processed only after explicit approval in `src/data/assets.json`; `npm run images` creates responsive formats and strips metadata. `npm run contact-sheet` produces a private review sheet from the ignored archive.

## Content and architecture

`src/data/` holds business facts, service enquiries, testimonial source text and FAQs. `src/render.js` supplies shared header/footer, route content and metadata through the in-repository Vite HTML plugin. Pages contain their content without JavaScript. Fonts are self-hosted; there are no UI frameworks or slider libraries. Optional consent-based tracking code is disabled; no real third-party tracking scripts load.

The site uses 16 construction photographs and the original logo from the archived source site, following the user’s explicit reuse instruction. Responsive derivatives and source hashes are committed; private originals are not required for a fresh build. A copywriter rewrote the content using source-supported services. No project facts or case-study outcomes have been fabricated.

## Deployment

**cPanel is the user-confirmed target.** It overrides the Cloudflare default in the attached document. Run `npm run package:cpanel` and use [the deployment guide](docs/cpanel-deployment.md). The archive and checksum are committed under `releases/`.

The site runs as static HTML/CSS/JS on the host, with PHP for session-verified enquiries, private SQLite storage/uploads and queued local-mail notifications. Node is not needed on cPanel. PHP extension/account configuration and actual mailbox delivery remain unverified. The static preview is https://logiagenesis.github.io/REgardin_GPT/. cPanel staging upload remains pending host access.

Upload to an isolated staging document root; keep private files outside every public root. The package stays noindex. Do not replace live WordPress or alter DNS/mail records. GitHub Actions runs QA and deploys a static design preview to GitHub Pages. cPanel remains the full PHP site target; Cloudflare is not required. Earlier Functions/Worker code remains historical source and is excluded from the cPanel package.

## GitHub Pages design preview

The Pages source in the user screenshot is GitHub Actions. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds and deploys main at `https://logiagenesis.github.io/REgardin_GPT/`. The earlier Pages release deployed successfully; each subsequent push triggers a new deployment whose result is checked separately. The preview uses repository-prefixed links/fonts/assets and disables backend requests. GitHub Pages cannot execute PHP; call/email preparation remains available. The full enquiry service runs in the separate cPanel package.

## Marketing integrations

Optional Formspree, direct GA4/GTM and Search Console HTML verification accept public build identifiers. See [activation instructions](docs/marketing-activation.md) for exact variables and recipient/property verification. Defaults remain disconnected; call, email-brief and WhatsApp contact links work on the beta. `npm run social:export` produces six source-grounded review graphics. The [current audit](docs/website-audit-04-10-2026.md) records live findings, design decisions and test boundaries.

For the requested coordinated 2K image batch, use [the exact image specification and prompts](docs/IMAGE_GENERATION_BRIEF.md).
